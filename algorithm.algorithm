take the break nodes and put them in a priority queue where the priority is when the break will happen
take out a node and look at all the edges around it
for all the edges except the edge used to get to the node using the attributes on the dge calculate when the connected node wil be reached
put this node in the priority queue
while there are sill nodes in the prioirty queue go back to line 2

what this achieves is the node which the wave will reach soonest will be next looked at so that animation will be inorder

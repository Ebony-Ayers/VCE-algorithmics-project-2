23/3/2020:
	Added basic structure of the cell class.
	The cell class is secion of a pipe which can receive a pressure wave and send it on.
23/3/2020:
	Removed the cell class.
	The moddel of splitting the n pipes into m cells where m >> n would be a less efficiant algorithm than calculating times.
23/3/2020:
	Imported the code from project 1
23/3/2020:
	Got pynode to run proerly and imported the pipes.csv file
23/3/2020:
	Added functionality for the user to place breaks and sensors.
23/3/2020:
	Added a new parameter to pynode::Edge.traverse which is how long the traverse will take.
	I belive this value is in miliseconds but I am not sure
2/5/2020:
	Disabled the ability to select the clear node
2/5/2020:
	Imported ADTs library from https://github.com/Joseph-Davies/vce-algroithmics-adts
3/5/2020:
	Added comments to the code where they were needed because it was rather complicated
3/5/2020:
	Added proper evaluation of CLI flags
	Started propogating wave
	Fixed new edges created around new node not having required attributes
3/5/2020:
	Disable starting the simulation twice
3/5/2020:
	Fixed printing of node objects
	Fixed issues with the ADTs library
	I stoped just making the wave come out of the breaks.
	I wanted to make the visualisation happen in real time. To do this I needed to store which nodes to
	go to in the future in time order. This was done with a prioirty queue as that ADT allows me to get
	the node with the closest time value associated. The time values were calculated based on pipe
	length and wave speed. This park wored greate but I had dificulties because I was miss calculating
	the time. I turns out that I was calculating the integral of time with respect to time. This made
	everything happen almost instaltly as with in a fraction of a second the program though thirty-thousand
	second had gone by. Once that was fixed the program mostly worked except that there was a slight
	error in the priority queue class thich meant that in certain circumstances enqueue operations
	were not processed. When this was fixed the program worked. Currently the code allows for loops
	which results in the number of waves exponentially increasing. This wil leventually crash python.
